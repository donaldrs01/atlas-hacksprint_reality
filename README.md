## Purpose of this Game
We created this web application during our HackSprint project in trimester 2 at Atlas School. We were given the prompt of "Reality," and we came to the conculsion of creating Reality Check. Finding inspiration from a New York Times article where it challenged the reader to dicpher between real images and ones that were AI generated.

## In Retrospect
The project dealine was only a week, we ran into some issues but were able to get the web application running in this basic form. If we were allowed more time the feature we would have included would be:

* Pulling data from FireStore and CloudRun instead of a JSON file.
* Enhanced the User Experience; ask more prompts consecutively, a place to keep score, leaderboard, etc.
* Make the game more challenging; using a API or LLM to generate news stories with more detail to create more believability to the fake stories.
